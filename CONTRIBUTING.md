6. Code Reviews: Coding standards are essential during code reviews.
                They provide a baseline for evaluating code quality and ensure that reviewers can focus on logic and functionality rather than style issues.
Coding Standards
 Consistency: Coding standards ensure that code looks and feels consistent throughout a project. This consistency makes it easier for developers to understand, maintain, and collaborate on code.

Readability: Well-defined coding standards prioritize code readability. Readable code is easier to understand, debug, and modify. It uses meaningful variable names, indentation, and proper formatting.

Maintainability: Maintaining software is a significant part of its lifecycle. Coding standards help ensure that code is maintainable by making it clear, organized, and free of unnecessary complexities.

Reduced Bugs: Consistent coding practices can lead to fewer bugs and errors in the code. When all developers follow the same guidelines, common pitfalls can be avoided.

Ease of Collaboration: In team environments, coding standards make it easier for multiple developers to work together on the same codebase. Everyone understands the same rules and conventions.

We follow specific coding standards and conventions in this project.
